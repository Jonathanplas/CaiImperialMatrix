<h2> How to install & run this </h2> 

You will need to install npm, which you can do by running the command ​sudo npm i​ in the top directory of this project.

Important Note: this ​never ​works on my machine until after a hard refresh, which is achieved by right clicking the page, clicking inspect, and then right clicking the reload button in Chrome to do an “Empty Cache and Hard Reload.”
